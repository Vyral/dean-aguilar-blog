        <title>4 Tips to Sell Your Home Quickly and for More Money</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/epn4MxYHPz4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are thinking about selling your home for the first time, here are four tips to help you sell quickly and for top dollar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a first-time home seller, there are a few things you should know before listing your home on the market. Here are my four tips to sell your home quickly and for more money:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price your home accurately from the beginning.&lt;/strong&gt; There are a few reasons behind this. One reason is that home buyers have their searches set up for a certain price point, so overpricing it may shrink your buyer pool. Secondly, once your home hits the MLS, if it’s priced properly, you have a much better opportunity to receive multiple offers right away. Also, when a home is overpriced, a buyer may either write a lowball offer or assume that there is something wrong with it and avoid writing an offer entirely.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clear the clutter from the home.&lt;/strong&gt; Prospective buyers want to be able to visualize themselves in your home. Removing the knickknacks and larger furniture will give these buyers a better idea of what the home is going to look like when they purchase it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put the upgrade money where it counts.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re thinking about investing in your home, my recommendation would be to make small upgrades. A new coat of neutral paint or new carpeting are very small improvements you can make that will make a world of difference in the eyes of the buyer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marketing, marketing, marketing. &lt;/strong&gt;Make sure that the real estate professional you hire has a full and solid marketing plan from beginning to end and that they have a strong online presence so that your home stays top of mind in this fast-moving market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep these four tips in mind, and you’ll be well on your way to a successful home sale. If you have any other questions about the home selling process or you’re thinking about buying real estate in our area, give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Should You List Your Home During the Fall?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WB1V59ywFqg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking about listing your home and are worried that the summer selling season is over, I have some good news for you—the fall is actually a great time to list your home. Why is this? Here are my top four reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Demand is strong.&lt;/strong&gt; With pending transactions up nearly 18% since last year, there are still a lot of buyers out there looking to buy homes. The low inventory levels in our area are creating more multiple offer situations, which is great news for you as a seller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. There is less competition on the market.&lt;/strong&gt; With school back in session and the holidays just around the corner, there are fewer listings on the market, which provides you a great opportunity to pick off the buyer pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Low inventory and high demand make fall a great time to sell.%20http://deanaguilarrealestate.com/should-you-list-your-home-during-the-fall.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Low inventory and high demand make fall a great time to sell.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. The lending process is quicker.&lt;/strong&gt; Because lenders are generally inundated with applications during the spring and summer, the loan process will generally take anywhere from 30 to 35 days. In the fall, however, we’ve seen loans close as quickly as 17 to 21 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Now is a great time to move up.&lt;/strong&gt; With home prices expected to increase 5.3% next year and builder confidence increasing, you’re presented with a great opportunity to move into the home of your dreams, saving you money on your down payment and mortgage payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about buying or selling a home during the fall, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to talking with you soon!&lt;/p&gt;
