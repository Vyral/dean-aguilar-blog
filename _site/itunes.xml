If you’re thinking about listing your home and are worried that summer selling season is over, I have some good news for you—the fall is actually a great time to list your home. Why is this? Here are my top four reasons:

1. Demand is strong. With pending transactions up nearly 18% since last year, there are still a lot of buyers out there looking to buy homes. The low inventory levels in our area are creating more multiple offer situations, which is great news for you as a seller.

2. There is less competition on the market. With school back in session and the holidays just around the corner, there are fewer listings in the market, which provides you a great opportunity to pick off the buyer pool.
“Low inventory and high demand make fall a great time to sell.”
3. The lending process is quicker. Because lenders are generally inundated with applications during the spring and summer, the loan process will generally take anywhere from 30 to 35 days. In the fall, however, we’ve seen loans close as quickly as 17 to 21 days.

4. Now is a great time to move up. With home prices expected to increase 5.3% next year and builder confidence increasing, you’re presented with a great opportunity to move into the home of your dreams, saving you money on your down payment and mortgage payment.

If you have any other questions about buying or selling a home during the fall, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to talking with you soon!
