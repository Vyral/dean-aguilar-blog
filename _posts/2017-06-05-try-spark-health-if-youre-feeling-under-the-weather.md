Beautiful weather, gorgeous real estate, and an active and healthy lifestyle are just a few reasons why people are so drawn to the Solana Beach community.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Speaking of active and healthy lifestyles, my latest appearance on “The American Dream” features myself and co-host Lindsey Tuer taking a visit to one of my favorite health and wellness establishments, Spark Health. We’re joined there by the owner, Dr. Aliza Cicerone, to discuss how this place can help you if you’re feeling sick.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>**Spark Health is a natural medicine clinic that focuses on integrative health care.** They use the natural medicine world and the conventional world to provide personalized medical care for their patients. Their treatment plans address all of your individual needs.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>According to Dr. Cicerone, what keeps patients coming back is their approach to healthcare and treating each person as a unique individual. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all plan, and they feel very supported the whole way through,” she notes. Their staff doesn’t see their patients every single week, but those patients know they have access to them and connect with their doctor on a much more meaningful level than what’s available in the conventional world.&nbsp;

<br>I had known of Spark Health from an earlier visit many years ago that was very successful, but it wasn’t until I was more recently feeling rundown that I decided to try it again and receive their IV therapy. I took the immune system bag for wellness and whatever it was that was ailing him was gone within 24 hours. Now, I’m hooked on Spark Health.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>**IV therapy uses all-natural vitamins, minerals, and amino acids and delivers them to your bloodstream** so your cells can use them immediately. That way you don’t have to deal with the digestive tract and different things being absorbed in different ways. This gives you a much better utilization absorption than taking supplements.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>**If you’re feeling rundown, you can come to them and get your own immune bag.** In order to have a custom bag created for you, you must be an established patient. To do this, you must meet with one of their doctors and have your entire health history reviewed so they know they can be safe and effective administering your IV therapy.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>For patients that aren’t quite established, they provide smaller IV bags or do vitamin injections. These treatments are very quick and usually last no longer than five minutes. Lindsey and I got our own quick treatment during our visit. As you can see in the video above, she’s feeling better already.&nbsp;
