If you haven't heard already, the Fed raised interest rates and are planning an aggressive approach in 2017. Since the week after the election, rates went up by about 0.5%. Since then, they went up another 0.25% for a total of 0.75%. We can expect that to be a full percentage point by mid-summer.

So what does this mean for you as a buyer or seller?

**As a buyer, the same home you could have purchased last year will now cost you more.** A $500,000 house, for example, would now have a monthly payment of about $200 to $300 more after recent rate increases. This impacts sellers, because the more affordable a home is, the more buyers will be able to buy it.

**The good thing for the market is that we still have historically low inventory.**If you're a seller, know that there aren't many homes available, but there are still buyers out there looking to buy and make offers. We know because we still get a lot of inquiries despite the increase in interest rates. With these interest rates, buyers will have a little bit more wiggle room to negotiate that you wouldn't have had in the past if you were competing against multiple offers on a home.

I want to be transparent, so I don't want to be like every Realtor who tells you that you absolutely should buy or sell now. If you're planning to move in June, you may want to consider moving in April or May if it's an option for you, though. As we go through 2017, there is a possibility that it could get worse.&nbsp;

As for sellers, there's nothing you can do to control the market and interest rates, but you can put your best foot forward. If you were planning to list and you have the ability to do it closer to spring or even after the new year as opposed to summer, you'll have a better chance to capture people trying to lock in a low rate.&nbsp;
