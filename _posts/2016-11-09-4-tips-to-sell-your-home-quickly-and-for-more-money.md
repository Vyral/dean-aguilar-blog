*If you are thinking about selling your home for the first time, here are four tips to help you sell quickly and for top dollar.*

If you’re a first-time home seller, there are a few things you should know before listing your home on the market. Here are my four tips to sell your home quickly and for more money:

1. **Price your home accurately from the beginning.** There are a few reasons behind this. One reason is that home buyers have their searches set up for a certain price point, so overpricing it may shrink your buyer pool. Secondly, once your home hits the MLS, if it’s priced properly, you have a much better opportunity to receive multiple offers right away. Also, when a home is overpriced, a buyer may either write a lowball offer or assume that there is something wrong with it and avoid writing an offer entirely.
2. **Clear the clutter from the home.** Prospective buyers want to be able to visualize themselves in your home. Removing the knickknacks and larger furniture will give these buyers a better idea of what the home is going to look like when they purchase it.
3. **Put the upgrade money where it counts.** If you’re thinking about investing in your home, my recommendation would be to make small upgrades. A new coat of neutral paint or new carpeting are very small improvements you can make that will make a world of difference in the eyes of the buyer.
4. **Marketing, marketing, marketing.**Make sure that the real estate professional you hire has a full and solid marketing plan from beginning to end and that they have a strong online presence so that your home stays top of mind in this fast-moving market.
