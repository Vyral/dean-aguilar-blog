*How can you win in a multiple offer situation when buying a home? There are four ways to make your offer stand out that I’ll discuss today.*

If you’re buying a San Diego home, you might find yourself in a multiple offer situation. Today I have four tips to help you win the home of your dreams if you run into one of these situations.

1. **Have a great lender working for you.** This can make all the difference in the world. A listing agent will want to look at the terms of an agreement, the bank you’re using, who the lender is, and what your strengths are as a buyer. In fact, in a perfect world, your lender should contact them when you submit an offer to tell them how strong of a buyer you are. They should also have already gathered all the paperwork needed for you to get approved and move forward.
2. **Reduce contingency periods when writing the offer.&nbsp;**Most people leave the contract the way it is with 17 days for things like inspections. If you reduce this period down to 10 or even seven days, you send a message that should anything come up in the inspection, you will negotiate it quickly. Sellers love this because it doesn’t hold up the property and shows that you’re willing to move forward.
3. **Hire the right team.** Too many agents don’t know how to win a multiple offer situation. When you have the right team in place, they will most likely have relationships with other agents that own the market share and the listings. If your agent has worked with the listing agent in the past and you’re competing against other offers with a properly written one, you’re probably going to win.
4. **Make it personal**. Unless the house is a flip, a personal touch means all the difference in the world. This could be a simple note, a photo of your family along with a personal letter, or video about your journey in the home buying process. This personal touch goes a long way with sellers, and you’ll truly stand out in a sea of offers.
