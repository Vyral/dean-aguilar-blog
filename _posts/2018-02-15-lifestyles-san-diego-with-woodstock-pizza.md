In my latest appearance on Lifestyles San Diego, we visit Woodstock Pizza and talk renting, owning and investing in the neighborhood.

Located in the heart of college Area next to San Diego State, Woodstock pizza is a favorite for all Aztec students. Their menu offers healthy options including gluten free options and nitrate free meats. Even the tomatoes in the sauce is picked, canned and shipped within 6 hours of harvest. Best thing yet, "If there is an ingredient you don't like on your pizza, you can bring your own".

Rents for two bedroom condos or homes start around $2000, averaging around $2300. Three, four or five bedroom homes can go as high as $4000 per month. Comparing the cost of living on campus and the benefit of owning and getting in-state tuition, parents are making an additional investment in their children and buying homes.

If you have any other questions, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to speak with you.
