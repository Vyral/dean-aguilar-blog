You might remember when I made an appearance on “The American Dream" **[recently](http://deanaguilarrealestate.com/check-out-my-recent-appearance-on-the-american-dream.html)**. I’m excited to tell you that they had me back along with my friend Andy to talk about how we help members of the military.

We help a lot of first-time homebuyers who come from the armed services, and I’m glad we got to address it in this appearance.

We also talked a little bit about the state of the San Diego market and the low inventory we’re seeing.

**Check out the video above to see our appearance!**

If you have any questions for me about the San Diego market, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be glad to help you.
