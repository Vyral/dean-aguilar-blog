If you’re thinking about buying a newly built home in 2017, I’ve got some great tips to share with you that will help make sure you are making a sound investment and not being taken advantage of.

The first tip is the most important, and that’s to **get your own agent as representation.** You wouldn’t walk into a car dealership and ask for the sticker price, right? It’s the same type of scenario. The agent you meet at the home works for the builder and is looking out for their best interest.&nbsp;

You need a professional on your side who will do the same. They will be able to read through the fine print of the contract, alert you to any potential mishaps, and make sure you get a great deal.

The next tip I have is to compare lenders. The builder and their agent will try to get you to work with their lender by offering you money off the purchase price or toward closing costs,** but they don’t tell you about the hidden fees they’ll hit you with and the true cost of the loan.** This is another thing a professional can help you with. They have done the homework and will be able to tell whether you are getting a good deal or not.

Finally, research the builder. Research their subcontractors if they have any, too. **See what people have to say about their homes online, whether it’s good or bad.** This is just another way to inform yourself so you’ll be protected when making such a large investment.
