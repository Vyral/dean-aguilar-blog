I recently made another appearance on "The American Dream," and **this time I brought along one of my young stars: top producer agent Collin Koppang.**
<br>
<br>Collin actually just turned 25 and opted for a career in real estate over a career as a lawyer. "It's your career path, right?" Collin said on the show. "You have to go after what you're passionate about. I really love helping people and that's kind of what I stuck to."
<br>
<br>We also got a chance to talk about the real estate market here in San Diego. We talked about how inventory is down 28% from last year and how creative buyers have to get to win the homes they want. We also talked about fluctuating interest rates, which just went up by 0.25% mid-June. The time it takes to sell a home here is still very fast, but we're starting to see those timelines get stretched out a bit. Interest rates will have this effect as well.

Collin also talked a bit about Mira Mesa and how this market has everything you need if you're someone who likes to stay in one place when it comes to things like restaurants, bars, and shops. It's also a popular spot for veterans thanks to three nearby military bases, as well as for families thanks to the great school systems.
<br>
<br>Collin said his favorite part about Mira Mesa is how unique all the homes are. You won't find cookie-cutter or tract homes there, according to Collin.
<br>
<br>Lastly, we both talked a little bit about our favorite parts of San Diego as a whole.
<br>
<br>Check out the video above to see our full appearance on the show.
<br>
<br>If you have any questions for me or Collin or you're thinking of buying and/or selling real estate here in the San Diego area, don't hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We'd love to help you!
