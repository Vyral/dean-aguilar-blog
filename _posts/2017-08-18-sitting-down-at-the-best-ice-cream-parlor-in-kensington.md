On my latest appearance on “The American Dream,” we’re talking real estate and ice cream at Moosie’s Ice Cream with owner Matt Brody.

I was introduced to Moosie’s last summer when I was visiting my brother, who just happens to live nearby it. Our kids were playing and when they wanted some ice cream, he recommended we go there. The line was huge, but it was well worth the wait. As it turned out, one of my agents actually knew Matt, which prompted me to get in touch with him.

Many people moving into Kensington work in the area Moosie’s is located in—Matt himself walks to Moosie’s every day. There are many eclectic shops in the surrounding neighborhood, which is part of this area’s unique appeal. **Moosie’s is a family friendly environment, and kids love it.**They switch out their flavors quite often, and their chocolate mousse sauce is Matt’s wife’s own recipe.

“Living here, I knew that was the one thing we really needed here—an ice cream store,” Matt says. “Just a little something you could do with the kids after dinner.”

The ice cream market is obviously hot in Kensington, but what about the real estate?

If you’ve owned a home in this area in the past few years, you’ve done well for yourself, as **home values have increased 12% year over year.** Inventory is low because people who move here tend to stay here. They also keep the housing style much like it was 100 years ago, with a lot of Spanish-influenced architecture.

Matt may be an ice cream parlor owner by night, but by day he’s an architect himself and knows the history of Kensington well. As he says, this neighborhood got started in 1910 and kept developing into the 1930s, and more than a few famous architects designed some of its houses. Today, he describes it as a throwback to a 1950s neighborhood.

“It’s a really special spot.”

Moosie’s contributes to the neighborhood’s family atmosphere by helping residents build lifelong friendships, and Matt is proud to have it act as an integral part of the community.

Being that we were in an ice cream shop, we couldn’t resist having a taste. Check out the video above to get a look at Moosie’s and see what we went with. For more information on Moosie’s, you can visit their website at **[Moosiesicecream.wordpress.com](https://moosiesicecream.wordpress.com/)**.
