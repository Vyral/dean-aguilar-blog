In my latest appearance on Lifestyles San Diego, we visit Taqueria Revoluciónv and talk the importance of having authentic food in the community.

Located in the heart of Chula Vista (with more locations across San Diego County), Taqueria Revoluciónv is a very popular choice for real Tijuana street tacos. Their menu is small, only offering 6 different types of tacos. Owner Emilio Tamez explains that if you are going to have a small menu, everything better be perfect. And wow, is it ever!  The Chula Vista community is right next to the border and still very affordable for buyers.

Being right by the border, it is important to have diverse authentic restaurant options. Owner Emilio Tamez explains, "We cook everything on a rotisserie, just like they do in Tijuana. Everything made daily, our first member comes at 1am to start cooking, meats are sourced from the US and never frozen".

If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I'd be happy to speak with you.
