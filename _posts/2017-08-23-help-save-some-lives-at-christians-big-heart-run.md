On my latest appearance on “The American Dream,” I’m joined by my good friend and VA lender Will Flores to talk about Christian’s Big Heart Run.

Three years ago, Will’s son Christian died tragically and unexpectedly from an undiscovered heart condition. In his memory, this 5k run is now held annually to raise money, provide free echocardiogram (EKG) screenings, and bring awareness to the dangers of sudden cardiac arrest.

Christian Flores passed away one day shy of his 19th birthday. He was attending college in Sacramento and visiting home for the weekend. When Sunday morning came, though, Christian didn’t wake up from his sleep.

Christian was an active athlete, and it’s easy to assume other active, seemingly healthy kids like him don’t have any serious medical issues. They undergo their normal physical to join whatever sport they decide to participate in, but there’s never an EKG involved. Unfortunately, it’s rare that parents take the time to do an EKG for their children. An EKG would’ve noticed Christian’s irregular heartbeat and given him the chance to seek treatment for it.

Will’s advice is simple: If you have kids, give them an EKG screening so the same tragedy doesn’t happen to you. Sudden cardiac arrest is the No. 1 cause of death among student athletes and the No. 2 cause of death for youths age 25 and under.

This year’s Christian’s Big Heart Run is happening on August 27th at Rohr Park. All the funds that will be raised will be donated to the Eric Paredes Foundation, which goes to local high school and performs free EKGs. Last year, they did 4,026 EKGs and discovered 17 severe cases and 47 abnormalities. During these free screenings, there is a doctor on site to assist with any questions about applying for medical insurance.

You’re more than welcome to come out and join us on August 27th. If you want to learn more about this fun-filled event or the Eric Paredes Foundation, visit **[Christiansbigheart.org](https://www.cristiansbigheart.org/)**.

If you have any other questions, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to speak with you.
